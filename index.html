            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a patented inventor and researcher dedicated to productionizing life-saving innovations in
                mathematics
                and computer science on continuously deliverable IT service platforms. As an developer, I advocate for
                <code>systems engineering</code> approaches to problems. I am primarily interested developing highly
                engineered products
                that are suitable for <i>constraining regulatory environments.</i> I focus on the application domains of
                <span class="focusDomain">emergency response systems,</span> 
                <span class="focusDomain">healthcare delivery,</span> 
                <span class="focusDomain">and financial services.</span>  
                <br /> <br />
                I have a range of experience in other fields including
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>embedded systems,</li>
                <li>electromyography,</li>
                <li>thermoplastics,</li>
                <li>garment manufacturing,</li>
                <li>business process improvement, and</li>
                <li>automotive control systems.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My research interests include</p>
            <ol>
                <li>optimization & operations research,</li>
                <li>online & optimal control systems, and</li>
                <li>chaos theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>While working for my current employer, Nakamura Partners, I created emergency response systems inventions
                that caused <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US10595183B2/">US Patent No. 10,595,183</a> to be
                issued in the companyâ€™s ownership (separate
                from and not affiliated with UCSD).
                <br /><br />
                Outside of work or school, I enjoy surfing, skateboarding, and playing the guitar.
